An end-to-end data analysis dashboard, that leverages a Modified Exploratory Analysis (mEDA) approach. 

The goal is manyfold:

Make it easy for data scientists to quickly inspect the workings and performance of their model in a few lines of code
Make it possible for non data scientist stakeholders such as managers, directors, internal and external watchdogs to interactively inspect the inner workings of the model without having to depend on a data scientist to generate every plot and table
Make it easy to build an application that explains individual predictions of your model for customers that ask for an explanation
Explain the inner workings of the model to the people working (human-in-the-loop) with it so that they gain understanding what the model does and doesn't do. This is important so that they can gain an intuition for when the model is likely missing information and may have to be overruled.
